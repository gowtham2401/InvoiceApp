## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 / 11
- [Visual Studio 2019 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Community edition is free)
- [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) — pre-installed on most modern Windows machines

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gowtham2401/InvoiceApp.git

# Open in Visual Studio
start InvoiceApp.csproj
```

1. Open `InvoiceApp.csproj` in Visual Studio
2. NuGet packages restore automatically on first build
3. Press **F5** to build and run

### Build via CLI

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

---

## 💾 Data Storage

All data is stored as human-readable JSON files in the `Data/` folder alongside the executable:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `customers.json` | All customer records |
| `invoices.json` | All invoice records with line items |
| `settings.json` | Invoice number sequence + company settings |

PDF exports are saved to an `Exports/` folder next to the executable.

---

## 🔢 Invoice Numbering

Invoices follow the format `INV-YYYY-0001`:
- Auto-increments on each new invoice
- Sequence resets to `0001` each calendar year
- Persisted across app restarts via `settings.json`
- Generated in the service layer — never in the UI

---

## 🔒 Validation

- Customer name is required
- Email format is validated
- Invoice must have at least one line item
- Quantity must be greater than 0
- Unit price cannot be negative
- Duplicate invoice numbers are prevented

---

## 📁 Output Folders

```
bin/
└── Debug/
    ├── InvoiceApp.exe
    ├── Data/
    │   ├── customers.json
    │   ├── invoices.json
    │   └── settings.json
    └── Exports/
        └── Invoice_INV-2025-0001.pdf
```

> **Note:** `bin/` and `obj/` are generated on build and are excluded from source control. The `runtimes/` folder inside `bin/` is placed there by QuestPDF and is required for PDF generation.

---

## 🧹 Cleaning the Project

**In Visual Studio:** Build → Clean Solution

**Manually:** Delete `bin/` and `obj/` folders — they are safe to remove and will regenerate on the next build.

**.gitignore** (recommended):
```
bin/
obj/
Exports/
```
